#Points to remember before giving Product based Interviews

1. Know their product well. (open their app, it's services, its core service).
2. Make notes on any suggestions you want to give to them (for ex: feature suggestion, improvement suggestion, user experience etc).
3. Know how they might have implemented their services. 
4. Show that you have similar work experience (end to end, for ex: if you are a frontend dev, say that you have experience handling end-to-end i.e. from figma design to implementation using stack, discussion with backend devs, product team, system desgin).
5. Tell how will you implement (steps from beginning to delivery).
