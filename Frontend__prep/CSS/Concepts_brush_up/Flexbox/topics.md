-- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a fundamental technology used for styling web pages. Here are some main concepts in CSS:

1. Selectors: Selectors are patterns used to select the HTML elements you want to style. They can be simple like element names (e.g., p for paragraphs) or more complex like class names (e.g., .classname) or IDs (e.g., #idname).

2. Properties: Properties are the stylistic attributes you want to apply to selected elements. They include things like color, font-size, background-color, margin, padding, etc.

3. Values: Values are assigned to properties and determine how they will be applied. For example, color: red, font-size: 16px, background-color: #FFFFFF, etc.

4. Selectors and Properties Relationship: CSS rules are made up of selectors and properties, combined to specify which elements the style applies to and what style is applied.

5. Cascading: Cascading refers to the process of combining multiple style sheets and resolving conflicts between conflicting styles. It follows a set of rules to determine which styles should be applied.

6. Specificity: Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied. It is based on the combination of selectors used to target elements.

7. Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism by which styles are passed down from parent elements to their children. Not all properties are inherited, but those that are will be passed down unless overridden by a child element.

8. Box Model: The box model describes how elements are rendered on the web page. It consists of content, padding, border, and margin. Each of these parts can be styled individually using CSS properties.

9. Layout: CSS provides mechanisms for laying out elements on a page. This includes techniques such as float, flexbox, and grid layout.

10. Responsive Design: With the increasing variety of devices and screen sizes, responsive design has become crucial. CSS offers features like media queries to adapt layouts and styles based on the device's characteristics.

11. Transitions and Animations: CSS allows for the creation of transitions and animations to add interactivity and visual interest to web pages.

12. Vendor Prefixes: Vendor prefixes are used to add browser-specific CSS properties. While not as common as they once were, they are still sometimes necessary for compatibility with older browsers.

13. Units: CSS supports various units for specifying sizes and distances, such as pixels (px), percentages (%), ems (em), rems (rem), viewport units (vw, vh, vmin, vmax), etc.

14. Comments: Comments can be added to CSS files to make the code more readable and understandable. Comments in CSS start with /* and end with */.

Understanding these concepts will give you a solid foundation for working effectively with CSS to style web pages.
