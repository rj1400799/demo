1. Name some block and inline elements

   Block-level elements:

   <div>: Generic container.
   <p>: Paragraph.
   <h1> to <h6>: Headings.
   <ul>: Unordered list.
   <ol>: Ordered list.
   <li>: List item.
   <table>: Table.
   <form>: Form.
   <header>: Header section.
   <footer>: Footer section.

   Inline elements:
  <span>: Generic inline container.
  <a>: Anchor (link).
  <strong>: Strong emphasis.
  <em>: Emphasis.
  <img>: Image.
  <input>: Input field.
  <label>: Label for an input field.
  <button>: Button.
  <abbr>: Abbreviation.
  <cite>: Citation.

*** Remember inline elements as (a img has an input, label and a button)
i.e. [a, img, button, input, label]

2. Difference between div and a span
   -- div is block level element and span is inline element
   -- div is a generic container 
   -- span is a inline container (can group inline elements).

3. inline-block elements in css
   
   In CSS, an inline-block element is a hybrid between a block-level and an inline element.

   Like inline elements, it flows within the text content and allows other elements to sit beside it on the same line.
   Like block-level elements, it can have a width, height, margin, padding, and border, and it starts on a new line.
