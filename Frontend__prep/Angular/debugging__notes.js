/**
 * Debugging: 
 * 1. Sometimes import won't work automatically, use manually import. 
 * 2. After fixing, vs code terminal, sometimes don't display that the issue is fixed, re-run app again.
 * 3. Our code is compiled by the angular CLI and converted to a compiled code, which then be running in the client.
 * 4. For debugging, we also have Source Maps which are introduced by the CLI which helps to map the code that is 
 *    actually executing to the original code you wrote. 
 * 
 * 5. Debugging steps button we see, 
 *    first --> resume
 *    second --> run next block (explore more)
 *    third --> step into currently executing function (dive into button)
